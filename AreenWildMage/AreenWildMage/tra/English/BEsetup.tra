@2 =      ~Areen~
@3 =      ~When asked about his past, Areen Selemchant regards you with a measured gaze that belies his mastery of wild magic. He speaks with careful precision about his parents, pioneering wild mages who perished in their pursuit of understanding the chaotic art. Their dedication to scholarly rigor lives on in their son, who views wild magic not as a source of whimsy, but as a discipline demanding intellectual fortitude.

His lips tighten when he mentions the recent loss of his magical items and books in a bandit ambush, though he seems more bothered by the disruption to his systematic study than the material loss itself. You notice how he bristles at tales of wild mages who treat their gift as a joke, considering them an embarrassment to the art his parents helped establish. Despite his rigid demeanor, there's an underlying current of passion when he speaks of combining magical theory with practical craftsmanship, though he's currently seeking to reconstruct his lost knowledge.~
