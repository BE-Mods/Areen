 ***************** AREEN THE WILD MAGE -- BGEE NPC MOD *****************
 ***********************************************************************

 VERSION: 1.0     PLATFORMS: BGEE, BGEE+SoD     AUTHOR: BORESAL
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION / DESCRIPTION:

This mod adds a joinable NPC, Areen the wild mage. Stats-wise is a strong character,
but it comes with a caveat that can be fixed progressively during the game.

Areen has small banter with all wizards of the game.

II. QUEST / ENCOUNTERS:

The mod does not include new quests or encounters (other than the spawning NPC).

It includes a few items that Areen could use and lore-appropiate reading books.

III. TWEAKS AND FIXES:

To make the wild magic experience more enjoyable and get the maximum of protecting spells like Chaos Shield and boost items, an optional component tweaks the wild surge table (WILDMAG.2DA) as follow:
- Most incapacitating surges (e.g., petrification, polymorph squirrel) are re-located
to lower rows, while more neutral, beneficial and "spell cast normally" surges appear on top. This makes spells like Chaos Shield way more effective as the most dangerous surges are between 1 and 15.
- Surges consisting in performing multible rolls have been replaced by other (neither extremly bad or extremely good) surges.

These changes will reduce reloading if the wild mage is played more systematically.

IV. INSTALLATION AND COMPATIBILITY:

Install as every WeiDU mod - copy the content of the archive into your main BGEE directory. Remember, that Steam users need to install modmerge first. Run Setup-ArenWildMage.exe and follow instructions on the screen. This mod requires an updated EE version of the game, preferably with Siege of Dragonspear.

The mod should be compatible with most BGEE mods that use WeiDU installation. You should start a new game to enjoy all-new content.
